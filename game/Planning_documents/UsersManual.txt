To move a tile, click once using the left mouse button and then click once on an empty tile to move it there. 
The selected tile that you plan on moving should have a border surronding it, letting you know which tile you have selected.
If you click on anything that isn't an empty tile, the tile you planned on moving will be deselected, indicated by the removal of its border.
