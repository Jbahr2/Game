Follow file naming rules, no spaces. (-5 points)

UML is not bad but the GameWindow has 2 variables and 4 methods and you only
have 1 variable and 3 methods in the diagram. (-2 points)

Why did you not give the documents file extensions. Having to quess which
application needs used to open them is upsetting. Fix This.

Do not care so much about the time things happened in the meetings, other than
start and end. Do need more detail. Who proposed what, and discussion?, whose
proposal was accepted, etc. Flesh these out in the future. 


Fix formatting, DO NOT use tabs for indentation. (-5 points)

All files do not have heading as required. (-5 points) And that heading is to be
the FIRST thing in the file. The "import" or other statements can come after. 

Make the window taller than it is wide, like 900x1000. 

Did not ask for things like R and xy in the tiles but okay. Follow the
instructions. If you are doing something just for your use take it out before
turrning it in. 

There is a lot of space in the window. Why did you make everything so small.
This must be fixed. I used 100x100 for the tiles and that word well. 
(-5 points)

Make it stop printing things to the terminal (with System.out). 

Why have you not filled in the exception handlers in Main.java?
